                <p id="p-Main">My Name is katelyn. I like playing piano, volleyball, and drawing. I am 16 years old and a sophomore in highschool. I like photography and was in a photo 2 class last semester, I also like learning about the medical field, and i'm currently in medical termiology and I really enjoy it. I took EMR last semester and I  really enjoyed that too. This is a website about my skills and awards, my portfolio, about me, and how to contact me. Enjoy.</p>
